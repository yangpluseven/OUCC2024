# Register Allocator

Everything from the original `compile/codegen/regalloc` should be moved here, and I think it's practical to put `Reg.java` and it's subclasses here too.

- reg_allocator.hpp
- reg_allocator_single_func.hpp
- machine_reg.hpp  (MReg.java)
- reg.hpp
- virtual_reg.hpp   (VReg.java)
